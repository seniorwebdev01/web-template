# Rust Web Boilerplate

## About
This is a boilerplate project made using best practices for getting started quickly
in a new project.

## Development setup

Install a few external dependencies and make sure `~/.cargo/bin` is in your `$PATH`:

    cargo install diesel_cli
    cargo install cargo-watch

Optionally if you want line coverage from your tests, install cargo-tarpaulin:

    cargo-tarpaulin

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update your application environment in this file.

Make sure you have a working local postgres setup. Your current user should be
admin in your development postgres installation and it should use the "peer" or
"trust" auth methods (see `pg_hba.conf`).

Now you can launch the `watch.sh` script which helps you quickly iterate. It
will remove and recreate the DB and run the migrations and then the tests on
all code changes.

    ./watch.sh

To get line coverage, do

    cargo tarpaulin --ignore-tests
